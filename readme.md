## 📌 Project Overview

IMDB Sentiment Analysis Engine is a production-ready NLP dashboard that predicts whether a movie review expresses a **Positive** or **Negative** sentiment.

The project explores and compares three popular Recurrent Neural Network architectures:

* Simple RNN
* LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
* GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

After experimentation, the **GRU model achieved the best balance between performance, convergence speed, and generalization**, making it the final deployed model.

The application provides:

* Real-time sentiment prediction
* Confidence score estimation
* Batch review processing
* Model evaluation dashboard
* Downloadable prediction results

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Movie reviews contain rich textual information that reflects user sentiment.

Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture long-term dependencies in text sequences.

To solve this problem, Recurrent Neural Networks were explored and compared to identify the most effective architecture for sentiment classification.

## 🏆 Why GRU Was Selected

During experimentation:

✅ Faster training

✅ Lower computational cost

✅ Better convergence

✅ Strong generalization capability

✅ Best validation performance

Therefore, the GRU model was selected as the production model and deployed through Streamlit.
